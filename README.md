# icc
icc is a toy C compiler I'm making for the first time.
I use [the book](https://www.sigbus.info/compilerbook) , written by Rui Ueyama, as a reference.
This project is in progress.
## How to run
1. Clone this repo.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:speed1313/icc.git
$ cd icc
```
2. Build the project.

```
$ make icc
```

3. Test

```
$ ./test.sh
```







# memo for me
 ``` zsh
 $ docker run --rm -it -v $HOME/programming/icc/:/icc compilerbook
 ```
